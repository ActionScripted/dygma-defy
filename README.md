# Dygma Defy Keyboard Layout

Custom keyboard layout for the **Dygma Defy**. This configuration is optimized for efficient typing and development workflow, with dedicated layers for symbols, functional keys, and advanced features.

## Layout Overview

This layout prioritizes **ergonomics over speed** and has been optimized for **macOS**, **Neovim**, and **shell** work. It minimizes weak finger usage and lateral movement by keeping outer columns inactive while remaining approachable for those used to standard QWERTY.

Symbols are organized by logical relationships. Openers and closers group together -- parentheses with brackets with braces. Related symbols cluster by function: math operators in one spot, comparisons in another, comments together.

**Physical modification:** Quote keycap was moved one left to replace colon/semicolon (absent from the base layer) and a blank was placed where the quote cap was. This suits my needs but may need adjustment depending what languages you use.

## Layer 5+: ???

These are either me abusing layers to move things around, back things up or play with some stuff like maybe having a gaming layer. Rough stuff above layer 4, just ignore these.
